# Hacker Experience Legacy



This is the source-code for Legacy, the first version of Hacker Experience I built from 2012-2014 and published on 2014. I made a promise I'd release it and here it is.

## Deploy

- So far, a tutorial for deploying the code hasn't been made, but as soon as it's done, I'll post it here!
## Disclaimer
The code is old so it's out of date I'll be updating it as I have time to try to make it stable and playable, I warn you that all responsibility for the code is exempt from both my part and the original developer
